            <h2>Welcome to My Web Demo!</h2>
            <p>Hey there! Thanks for checking out this little project. It's a hands-on demonstration of how I approach fundamental web development – focusing on solid HTML structure, clean CSS styling, and making sure everything looks great and works smoothly on any device, big or small.</p>
            <p><strong>Just so you know, I put this together as part of my application for the Web Development Trainee position at SaralTech™. You might notice some content similarities with another assignment; this particular version specifically highlights my proficiency in CSS Layouts, especially using Flexbox, to create a more robust and adaptable design.</strong></p>
            <p>My main goal here is to show you that I can build a clean, easy-to-manage, and user-friendly web layout from scratch.</p>
            <p>Feel free to click around the navigation links above. You'll find a quick peek at the kinds of web services I'm showcasing, a bit about the project itself, and a way to get in touch.</p>
            <h3>What you'll see here:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A website built with good old HTML5, structured just right.</li>
                <li>All the styling done purely with CSS – no fancy frameworks or JavaScript for the main layout.</li>
                <li>It's fully responsive, so it should look good whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or phone.</li>
                <li>A neat trick using only CSS to switch between content sections without any page reloads.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="tasks">
            <h2>My Daily Tasks (Demo)</h2>
            <p>This section provides a static representation of a simple task management interface. It's designed to illustrate how tasks could be displayed and managed in a real application, even though the add/remove/edit actions here are purely visual for this demonstration.</p>

            <h3>Current Tasks:</h3>
            <ul class="task-list">
                <li><input type="checkbox" id="task1"><label for="task1">Finish Web Development Assignment for SaralTech™</label></li>
                <li><input type="checkbox" id="task2"><label for="task2">Review responsive design principles</label></li>
                <li><input type="checkbox" id="task3"><label for="task3">Prepare for upcoming interview</label></li>
                <li><input type="checkbox" id="task4"><label for="task4">Buy groceries</label></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="task-actions">
                <button class="task-button add-task">Add New Task (Demo)</button>
                <button class="task-button remove-task">Remove Selected Task (Demo)</button>
                <button class="task-button edit-task">Edit Task (Demo)</button>
            </div>

            <p class="note">Please note: The checkboxes and buttons in this section are for visual demonstration only. In a live application, these would be interactive and powered by JavaScript to manage your tasks dynamically.</p>

        <section id="about" >
            <h2>About This Little Project</h2>
            <p>So, this Task Bar project? It's really just a hands-on way for me to show off some core web development skills. My main goal here was to create a clean, responsive, and robust layout using foundational web technologies. I leveraged HTML for structure and CSS, particularly Flexbox, for all the visual flair and dynamic arrangement of content.</p>
            <p>I was also keen on setting up a functional navigation system that lets you jump between sections without needing any JavaScript – all thanks to a neat CSS trick called the `:target` pseudo-class.</p>
            <p>Through building this, I really focused on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sticking to modern web standards and best practices.</li>
                <li>Keeping the code tidy and easy to understand.</li>
                <li>Making sure it's accessible and friendly for anyone using it, no matter their device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's a small demonstration, but I hope it gives you a good idea of how I approach building engaging web experiences with just HTML and CSS.</p>
